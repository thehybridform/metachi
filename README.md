I have a simple task for you to do as part of our vetting process.  Use the src/main/web/people.json json file that contains an array of people with name, age, and sex.  Create an angular js driven app that reads this file and displays the contents in a organized table.  Please use Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com for the css.  The table should be filterable and sortable on first name, last name, age, and sex.

Also provide jasmine unit tests using karma with grunt as the task runner.  I would like to see this save as a github project.  I want to be able to sync the project and run grunt to build and test with code coverage.

What I'm looking for is code quality, organization. and maintainability.
